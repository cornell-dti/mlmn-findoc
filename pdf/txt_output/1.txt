    course description: This course develops techniques used in the design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on problems arising in computing applications. Example applications are drawn from systems and networks artificial intelligence computer vision data mining and computational biology.
    learning objectives: 
        Identify problems solvable with different algorithm design techniques
        Analyze computational efficiency of algorithms
        Recognize computationally intractable problems
        Apply algorithmic techniques for intractable problems
        Understand and implement famous algorithms
        Write proofs and analyze algorithmic runtime

    collaboration policy: Collaboration is allowed on problem-solving ideas but solutions must be written up independently and acknowledge collaboration.
    late submissions policy: 
        late days allowed: 6
        penalty structure: 
                late submission hours: 0-12
                penalty: 20%
                late submission hours: 12-48
                penalty: additional 20%
        exceptions: Grades from a late submission count only if you have late days left.
    academic integrity policy: 
        collaboration guidelines: Collaborate on ideas write up solutions independently acknowledge collaborators.
        admissible resources: Only course materials and discussions allowed no external resources permitted.
    additional information: 
        typesetting requirements: Homework must be typeset and submitted as PDF.
        inclusiveness statement: Respectful communication and inclusive behavior are expected from all participants.
        accommodations policy: Students with disabilities should request accommodations within the first three weeks of the semester.
