      "everyone is familiar with the material in CS 2110, CS 3110, and CS 2800, and we will use it as nec-\n",

      "expectation, variance), sorting, and basic terminology involving graphs (including the concepts\n",
      "of depth-ﬁrst search and breadth-ﬁrst search), and coding (in Java, or one of the other languages\n",
      "supported – see Programming Assignment Instructions). Some of these are reviewed in the text.\n",
      "The lectures and homework involve the analysis of algorithms at a fairly mathematical level. A\n",

      "nents of the course material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typesetting\n",
      "We will require problem sets to be typeset and submitted as a PDF. This requirement is for\n",
      "everyone’s beneﬁt. In general, we recommend that you ﬁrst develop your solutions in draft form,\n",
      "and then write or type your solution in a concise way. Typesetting not only makes the last step\n",
      "essential (instead of handing in solution in draft form), it also makes it much easier for you to edit\n",
      "and improve your writeup, as well as easier for your TAs to read your proofs. It is up to you which\n",
      "tool you use; though we recommend LaTeX, tools like the Equation Editor in Microsoft Word can\n",
      "be surprisingly eﬀective as an alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some proofs or writeups, it may be helpful to use a ﬁgure to explain your thinking more\n",
      "concisely. This is encouraged! Again, it is up to you how you want to include that in your writeup,\n",
      "whether it is a picture of a drawing in your notebook that you took with your phone or something\n",
      "you made digitally, as long as the ﬁgure was produced by you personally and is clear enough to\n",
      "see, it’s a great idea to include it.\n",

      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\fLate Submissions\n",
      "You have six late days. Grades from a late submission count only if you have late days left. You\n",
      "can use at most three late days per homework. The purpose of late days is to help handle unforseen\n",
      "circumstances such as illness, interviews, or conﬂicting deadlines that may prevent you from\n",
      "turning in your assignment on time. Requests for additional late days will not be granted\n",
      "except in truly extraordinary circumstances, such as hospitalization or the death of a loved\n",
      "one. If such an emergency arises, contact the instructor as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaboration\n",
      "\n",
      "In the real world of algorithms research, collaboration and conversation is an important part of\n",
      "how ideas get generated. So too in this course; we encourage you to discuss with your peers in the\n",
      "course to brainstorm ideas for how to get through homework. However, your solution must be\n",
      "written up completely on your own; you are not allowed to share digital or written notes\n",
      "or images of your work in any form with each other. Just like in research, your work must\n",
      "also include acknowledgements of all students with whom you collaborated. Both the physical or\n",
      "digital distribution of information about solutions and the failure to acknowledge collaborators\n",
      "are serious violations of academic integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admissible Resources\n",
      "For the homework, it is not admissible to use resources beyond course material and student\n",
      "discussions. In particular, you may not use Wikipedia, or search the Web, or look at any textbook,\n",
      "other than the ones assigned/recommended in the course. Using such additional resources is a\n",
      "violation of academic integrity. If you feel the resources available to you are insuﬃcient, talk to\n",
      "course staﬀ or ask questions on Ed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advice for Success\n",
      "\n",
      "Algorithms assignments can often require creative insights and complex proofs beyond what\n",
      "previous courses have required. Here are a few tips for succeeding in your writeups:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Start your assignments early. Even if you aren’t writing anything down yet, looking over\n",
      "the problem set well in advance of the due date can ensure you have enough time to brain-\n",
      "storm possible solutions and to clear up confusion about how to interpret a problem. Cre-\n",

      "\n",
      "• Talk with classmates at a similar level about ideas. As previously stated, while you can-\n",

      "you to talk to classmates while you work through them. In particular, we recommend ﬁnd-\n",

      "equitable, and is more likely to leave you prepared for course exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Ask questions in class, in ofﬁce hours, and on Ed Discussions. The material in this class\n",
      "moves quickly and is often cumulative. If you ﬁnd yourself scratching your head after a\n",
      "lecture, even after consulting the textbook and course notes, you’re certainly not alone,\n",
