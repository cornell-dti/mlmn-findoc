Course description
Intermediate programming in a high-level language and introduction to software engineering. Topics include object-oriented programming (classes, objects, subclasses, types), graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis (asymptotic complexity, big “O” notation), recursion, testing, program correctness (loop invariants), searching/sorting, data structures (lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hash tables, graphs), graph algorithms. Java is the principal programming language.
Prerequisites
CS 1110 or CS 1112 or equivalent course on programming in a procedural language.
Learning outcomes
Employ recursion and object-oriented programming concepts (e.g. classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces) to solve computational problems.
Design and implement nontrivial Java programs (roughly 1000 lines of code), starting from an English language specification.
Build and modify event-driven graphical user interfaces (GUIs) expressed in Java.
Analyze the asymptotic complexity of algorithms and programs to determine their running times.
Implement basic data structures taught in the course (linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables, adjacency lists) and be able to use them in programs.

Individual appointments: To schedule an individual appointment with an instructor, see the office hours page.
Teaching assistants
Discussion sections are led by graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs). The TA roster can be found in Canvas.
Consultants
Undergraduate consultants assist groups during discussion sections and hold consulting hours for one-on-one assistance with programming assignments.
Administration
Ms. Corey Torres serves as the Course Coordinator for CS 2110. You should coordinate with her in the event of last-minute exam conflicts and may see messages from her related to conflicts you report on our surveys.
Meeting times
Lectures are held Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:10am to 11:00am in Statler Auditorium (Statler Hall 185). Discussion sections meet once per week for 50 minutes on either Tuesday or Wednesday (see class roster for times and locations). Class begins on January 24 and ends on May 9, totaling 28 50-minute lectures and 13 50-minute discussions (see schedule). Attendance and participation are expected in both lectures and discussions.
Lectures will start promptly on time, so please do your best to be settled before 10:10am. The instructors will try hard to end lectures no more than 60 seconds past 11:00am, so please be respectful and refrain from packing up until class has been dismissed.
We expect the lecture hall to be completely full at the start of the semester, so please fill every available seat (do not leave gaps), preferring front and center seats to minimize disruption from students who arrive later. Balcony seating is also available. For fire code reasons, you may not stand or sit in the aisles or bring in additional chairs. If you are not yet enrolled in the course, please refrain from attending lecture until you are to ensure that we do not exceed fire code limits.
Please attend the discussion section in which you are enrolled—many classrooms are filled to capacity, and TAs occasionally send follow-up notes to the students enrolled in their section. If you have a one-time conflict with your regular section, you are allowed to attend another section so long as it is not full (look for the green dot on the class roster). But if you develop a habit of attending another section, you should change your enrollment on StudentCenter to match. Note that instructors cannot change your section enrollment; you must go through the registrar.
We will attempt to record audio and screen captures from lectures on a best-effort basis to help students who miss lecture for illness keep up with the material; these recordings may be viewed on Canvas.
Credits and grade basis
3 credits, letter or S/U grades, audits allowed.
Credits reflect scheduled contact hours and associated work, including roughly biweekly programming assignments.
Auditors are permitted to participate fully in the class, including submitting assignments, attending office hours, and receiving scores on assignments and exams.
Office hours and consulting
See our office hours page for times, locations, and appointment reservation instructions for office hours offered by instructors, TAs, and consultants. If a last-minute change must be made to the schedule, this will be announced on Ed Discussion. Consulting hours and most TA office hours take place in Rhodes 405 (tentative).
During instructors’ office hours, we are happy to answer high-level questions about course content for any students who stop by. This is intended to be a small-group setting, and we may poll several students for questions and answer them out of order for the benefit of the group. We can also share related anecdotes from our experience applying course concepts in research and industry.  Questions about assignments will not be prioritized unless you have been referred to us by a consultant or TA. Be advised that “camping out” in office hours is not a strategy for success in this course; rather, when you come to office hours, you should have focused questions that you have already written down.
Instructors may also be available for a limited number of one-on-one appointments, which must be reserved in advance.  These are best suited for discussing accommodations, getting advice on how to study, reviewing your performance, or resolving partner conflicts (please specify your agenda in advance); they should not be used for assignment help.  If you reserve an appointment, you are expected to attend.
All TAs’ office hours are open to all students (you are not restricted to the TA who teaches your discussion section). As with instructors’ open hours, TA office hours are able to accommodate small groups of students who may have related points of confusion; therefore, they are great for addressing high-level questions about course content (lectures & reading), past quizzes, lab exercises, and general approaches to assignments. If the session is quiet, the TA may be able to provide individualized assistance with debugging your assignment code, but priority will be given to assistance that can benefit everyone present.
Consulting hours are dedicated to one-on-one assistance (or two-on-one if working with an assignment partner). Consultations are first-come, first-served. Our consultants have all taken a version of CS 2110 or 2112, so they can answer questions about material as well as assignments. Because of the one-on-one setting, consulting is the best way to get individualized assistance with assignment debugging.
Students should not expect more than 10 consecutive minutes of individualized attention during a consultation, as we need to keep the queue moving. Therefore, please come prepared with specific questions, having already read the lecture notes or assignment + skeleton code, attempted a design or test plan, and identified a failing diagnostic. Remember that consultants are not there to implement assignments for you, so expect to be asked to work independently and rejoin the queue even if consulting hours are quiet.
Materials and services
Textbook
The primary textbook for this course is Data Structures and Abstractions with Java, Fifth Edition, by Frank M. Carrano and Timothy M. Henry. A paper copy is recommended, as it will likely improve your retention of the material, but an ebook is also acceptable.
Readings may also be assigned from the following free online references:
JavaHyperText—online textbook originally prepared for CS 2110 by Cornell professor David Gries
Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures—online course notes originally prepared for CS 2112 by Cornell professors Andrew Myers and Dexter Kozen
The Java Tutorials—official tutorials from the creators of the Java language
We recommend that students at least skim relevant readings before lecture, then re-read them carefully afterwards.
iClicker remotes
Lectures for this class will include problems for you to solve in your seats and answer using an iClicker remote. Therefore, iClicker remotes are required for this class. You will need a physical remote, not an app on your phone (neither the WiFi in our lecture hall nor the iClicker instructor software are stable enough to use it at the scale of 600+ students).
Your remote does not need to be new—a used “original,” “plus,” or “2” model would be fine, and it can be used in future courses as well (such as CS 3410). If you signed up for the Cornell Academic Materials Program (CAMP), you should be able to pick up a remote from the bookstore for free. You will need to register your remote on Canvas.
Try to have your remote ready by the start of classes, but don’t worry if it takes a few extra days to acquire one—responses will not count towards your grade until after Cornell’s “add” period ends on February 6. When using your remote in class, look for a positive confirmation that your response was received (e.g. a green light). If you see a negative confirmation (e.g. an orange light), ensure that your remote is set to the correct frequency (we will use the default, “AA”). If you see no confirmation at all, check your batteries. A “score” counting your responses will be regularly updated on Canvas; check it to ensure that your remote is registered and successfully communicating.
Personal technology
Students will need regular access to a computer in order to complete this course. You will need the ability to interact with course websites, read PDF documents, extract and create ZIP archives, and run a Java development environment (preferably IntelliJ IDEA). A USB stick will come in handy should you need to use a loaner laptop or computer lab at some point during the semester (have a plan for what to do if your primary computer breaks down).
If you have a personal laptop, we recommend bringing it to discussion sections—some activities will require at least one group member to use a computer. Please try to keep your laptop well charged, as most classrooms lack accessible power outlets (and charging cables that present a trip hazard will not be allowed). A laptop is not required in lectures, however. Multitasking on phones or laptops is known to impede learning and lower grades for both you and your neighbors, so we ask that you refrain from using them and take notes on paper if possible. Students who may nevertheless be tempted to multitask on a notetaking device should sit in the back of the lecture hall (and classmates should not hesitate to ask distracting neighbors to relocate there).
Online services
The course will utilize the following online services, most of which you can access with your Cornell account once you are logged into Canvas:
Course website (lecture materials and assignments; accessible to public)
CMSX (assignment submission, grades)
Canvas (announcements, quizzes and surveys)
Ed Discussion (class discussion board)
Gradescope (exam feedback)
Assessment
Basis of grade determination
Student performance will be assessed using the following elements, weighted approximately as indicated to yield an overall performance score:
Participation   5%
Lecture (iClicker)  2.5%
Discussion (cooperative exercises)  2%
Course evaluation   0.5%
Quizzes 6%
Assignments 31%
Assignment 1    3%
Assignment 2    4%
Assignment 3    5%
Assignment 4    5%
Assignment 5    4%
Assignment 6    6%
Timeliness  4%
Prelim 1    16%
Prelim 2    16%
Final   26%
Grading scale
Letter grades are assigned in accordance with the Cornell University grading system based on the instructor’s assessment of knowledge & understanding, perception, and originality reflected in a student’s work (weighted as described above). Historically, about 35% of students receive a grade of A- or higher, and the median grade has been a B.
Grade boundaries are not known in advance, as assignments and rubrics vary between semesters.  But to help you manage your expectations, we guarantee that:
Performance scores above 90% will receive at least an A-
Performance scores above 77% will receive at least a B-
Performance scores above 60% will receive at least a C- as long ...

Discrete Structures
CS 2800 Spring 2022 Syllabus – SUBJECT TO CHANGE
Course content
Course description
Discrete mathematics is the mathematical backbone of computer science. Contrary to continu-
ous mathematics (which includes, for example, calculus) which deals with objects that can take
on any value in a specified range, discrete mathematics deals with objects that can only take
distinct, separated, values. This course gives an introduction to concepts and structures in dis-
crete mathematics that are useful in describing and analyzing objects in computer science and
information science. This course will provide an introduction to the following topics:
• mathematical proofs, introduction to logic, and induction;
• sets, functions, relations, and graphs;
• number theory;
• combinatorics, and probability theory;
• automata;
• (if time permits) some graph theory and logic.
Topics will be discussed in the context of applications to various areas of computer science.
Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, you should be able to:
• use the basic objects of mathematics (sets, functions, relations, probability spaces, graphs)
to model problems arising in computer science;
• read and understand unfamiliar mathematical definitions, generate examples and coun-
terexamples, formulate precise definitions, determine whether a given object satisfies a
definition;
• write mathematical proofs (for example for algorithm correctness and analysis) that are
both clear and precise, using standard techniques (esp. induction); find errors in faulty
proofs;
• be proficient in using counting techniques and probabilistic arguments that are used for
algorithm analysis.
Prerequisites
The official prerequisite for course is a programming course. It is OK to take CS 1110 or CS 2110
concurrently.

• Asking questions:
– Please use Ed Discussions to ask questions about homework, exams, course logistics,
etc. You can make a private post if your inquiry is personal.
– You can make an appointment with the instructor using the Calendly 1-on-1 link from
Canvas. Appointments slots are limited, and are meant for discussing topics you can-
not discuss in public office hours (so not for homework questions!)
• Accessing course materials: We will be using Canvas to distribute homework and lecture
materials. You should be enrolled automatically into Canvas, but if not, please visit https:
//Canvas.cornell.edu and search for CS 2800. All announcements for the class will be
through Canvas and/or Ed Discussions, so it is your responsibility to ensure that you are
enrolled and receiving the announcements. Please contact the instructor or the TAs if you
have any issues. All websites we use (e.g., Gradescope for homework submission, Ed Dis-
cussions for Q&A) are linked from the course Canvas site.
Academic Excellence Workshop ENGRG 1028
Academic Excellence Workshop (AEW) sections are available to be taken in conjunction with this
course. AEWs are optional 1-credit supplemental courses which meet for one 2-hour collabora-
tive problem-solving session each week throughout the semester. Designed to enhance student
understanding, the workshops feature group work on problems at or above the level of course
instruction. In the workshops, small-group problem-solving is directed by undergraduate peer
educators called facilitators. The AEWs are graded S/U, based on attendance.
For this course there are two sections of ENGRG 1028 available: Mondays at 7.30pm and Tues-
days 2.40pm.
You can enroll online during the add period. Space is available, but may fill up quickly. If there
are no spots available in a section that fits your schedule, use the link included with the course
listing in the registration system to indicate your interest and availability. For more information
about AEWs, visit http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/aew.
Textbooks
• Mathematics for Computer Science by Eric Lehmann, Albert Meyer, and Tom Leighton.
This is our main text; the homework assignments and exams will have problems similar to
(or taken from) this text. It can be downloaded for free from https://courses.csail.
mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf.
2
• Discrete Mathematics ZY Book by Sandy Irani.
This optional interactive online text is available for $58. Access it using the reading assign-
ment on Canvas (go to Assignments in the course navigation menu on the left). This text
provides a plethora of participation activities for you to check your understanding of the
concepts introduced in class. These activities are a bit easier than the homework problems
you will need to solve, but students have reported they really help to get a solid under-
standing of the concepts taught in CS2800. Completing the activities will count towards
your participation credit (see below).
• Some useful backup texts are Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics by Stephen B. Maurer and
Anthony Ralston, A. K. Peters, Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth Rosen,
and the lecture notes by Cornell’s Rafael Pass and Wei-Lung Dustin Tseng https://www.
cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/discmath.pdf.
The material on automata is not covered in our two main texts; you will be provided with
a copy of a chapter of Rosen’s book and of Pass and Tseng’s notes for this material.
Course work
Participation
• Lectures include short interactive exercises (via PollEverywhere) which invite you to think
about the material and check your understanding. Lecture participation counts for 25% of
your participation grade.
• Reading assignments related to the material discussed in lecture will be posted on Canvas.
There are two textbooks and you can, but are not required to, read either or both. The in-
teractive reading assignments in the ZYBook count towards your participation grade. The
reading assignments will have a deadline by which you need to complete the activities to
get credit. There is no credit for activities completed after this time. Reading participation
counts for 25% of your participation grade.
• Discussion sections will not introduce new material, but they will give you an opportunity to
work together with your peers and TAs. Participation credit for discussion is based on the
percentage of discussions during which you actively worked on the material provided that
week. If you attend but are not working on the discussion, the discussion TAs have the right
to mark you absent. Discussion participation counts for 75% of your participation grade.
The learning activities during lectures, reading, and discussion sections are meant to help
you check your understanding, and count towards your participation grade; this means that you
are not expected to give the correct answer, but that we do expect you to make an effort to learn.
Because different people have different preferences on how to learn and keep up with the
material, the three categories of participation credit add up to 125%; this means you have multiple
options for getting a perfect score (but your score is capped at 100%).

Homework
The goal of homework is to make you think deeper about and work with the material in the course,
thereby reinforcing the material. The homework (and discussion exercises) are meant to be chal-
lenging, and to take some time to solve. So do not panic if you do not immediately see how to
approach a problem, and do not ask for help straight away; you learn much more if you manage
to find a way forward on your own after a bit of struggle. In other words, the goal of the home-
work is meant as an exercise to sharpen your understanding and to find possible holes in your
understanding. If you do not do your own homework, then this setup does not work. We grade
the homework to give you feedback and help you pinpoint which parts of the course you fully
understand and which you have to review.
Homework will be assigned every week, and will be collected via Gradescope; there will be
approximately 9-10 homework assignments in total. It is OK if you handwrite your answers and
upload a photo (converted to a single pdf), or, alternatively, you can typeset them using LaTeX.
We will post the LaTeX source files of the homework for those of you who want to typeset your
answers in the same file.
Homework policies
• The lowest assigment grade is dropped.
• Late assignments are accepted until 24 hours after the deadline.
• You can submit one late assignment for any reason with no penalty; in addition, you can
submit one late assignment because you are ill with covid or your week is disrupted because
of contact tracing or quarantining.
• Subsequent late assignments will have the following penalties applied: 0–5 minutes: no
penalty; 5–30 minutes: 5%, 30–60 minutes: 20%, 1 – 24 hours : 50% penalty.
• Regrade requests for homework assignments and exams should be submitted on Grade-
scope, within five days of when grades are released. We will regrade the entire exam or
problem set; your score may go up or down.
• You are allowed and even encouraged to discuss the homework problems with your class-
mates. However, you have to write down the solutions on your own, without referring to any notes
taken while discussing the problems with classmates or TAs. Showing each other written solu-
tions, or writing out large parts of your solutions together, is not acceptable. Please indicate
on your homework the netIDs of your collaborators.
• Note that TAs do not have the solutions, and may make mistakes. Office hours are not for
checking your work for mistakes (this is what grading is for).
• You are not allowed to use sites like Chegg, Coursehero, or other sites that have homework
solutions. Posting questions from this course to these sites is a violation of copyright and
of Cornell’s academic integrity code. Getting answers from these sites deprives you of the
chance to struggle with the problems yourself – and you really do not want to postpone
that struggle to the exam!
• Violations of the homework collaboration policy or accessing homework solutions found
4
online result in a score of negative 50% (−50%) for the assignment.
Exams
The goal of the exams is to reinforce the material, by giving you an incentive to review the ma-
terial, and for us to check that you understand the material at a sufficient level to be able to use
it in future courses.
There will be two prelims and a final exam. The prelim exams are scheduled for the following
two dates: Thursday March 17, 7:30pm and Thursday April 21, 7:30pm. The date for the final
exam is to be determined. The exams will be held in-person.
In addition, there might be in-class quizzes.
Exam policies
• Clear guidelines will be given about what course materials you will be allowed to access
while taking the exams.
• Communicating with any person or accessing unauthorized resources during the exam is
considered to be a violation of academic integrity. Not reporting requests of other students
who ask for help is also a violation.
• Violations of academic integrity during a prelim or final exam result in an F in the course.
Grade determination
90% is 100% for participation and homework
The percentage of completed polls for lecture participation, completed exercises for reading, and
actively attended discussions each get multiplied by 10/9 (rounded down to 100 if necessary).
Similarly, grades for each homework are 10/9 times the raw grade for the homework (rounded
down to 100 if necessary).
Weighting of course components
The following table gives ranges for the weights used for the different parts that make up your
final grade. I will compute your score by setting each weight to its lowest value (giving 80% of
your score) and then increasing the weight of the components on which you scored highest to
their highest value to get to 100%.
Homework 15-25%
Participation 5-10%
Prelim 1 (and Quiz 1) 15-25%
Prelim 2 (and Quiz 2) 15-25%
Final exam 30-40%
5
General policies
We urge you to talk to the instructor or any of the TAs if you have any concerns about your learn-
ing, grades, or progress in the course, or if you get sick or if you have other difficulties. You can
make an appointment for a 1-on-1 meeting with professor Van Zuylen at https://calendly.
com/avz2/15min. Other resources at Cornell are also available (caringcommunity.cornell.
edu).
Please do not use email to ask questions about the material, policies, exam dates, etc. You
can submit questions like these to Ed Discussion, where everyone can view the reply as well (and
don’t forget to search whether a question has been asked already).
We cannot accommodate requests for exceptions for minor issues (not being able to answer
poll questions due to WiFi issues, leaving early for a break, forgetting to submit a homework, as
examples) — the course policies and grading scheme have been set up to take care of this. We are,
of course, more than willing to accommodate major unexpected events (for instance, you being
hospitalized unexpectedly, death of a close family member). In case you get sick, or there is some
other unexpected emergency, please set up a meeting or send an email, and we will figure out
how to handle the situation together.
Accommodations
We provide the usual academic accommodations for students with special needs and/or disabil-
ities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the
semester and must be accompanied by official documentation. Please register with Student Dis-
ability Services to document your eligibility.
Please talk to the instructor or TAs if there you have requests because of the current circum-
stances that do not fit under the “usual accommodations”, and we will work together to see if
and how we can accommodate your requests.
Academic integrity
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic In-
tegrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student’s
own work. Complete code is available at http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html.
Prohibition against buying and selling of course materials
Course materials, posted on Canvas, Zoom/Video on Demand, Gradescope, Ed Discussions, or
otherwise, are intellectual property belonging to the author/instructor. Students are prohib-
ited from posting, buying or selling any course materials without the express permission of the
instructor.
